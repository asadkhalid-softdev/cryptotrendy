# Current Progress - CryptoTrendy

**Status:** All core components outlined in the architecture document have been implemented.

## Implemented Features:

1.  **Data Collection:**
    *   Fetching trending coins, market data (market cap, price %, volume) from **CoinGecko API**.
    *   *(Optional but available)* Scraping Reddit/Twitter data using `snscrape`/`Twint` and `PRAW`.
    *   Data is merged into structured JSON per coin.

2.  **Data Preprocessing/Formatting:**
    *   Scores (e.g., volume) are normalized (0-1 scale).
    *   Social media comments/posts are formatted for clarity.
    *   Data is prepared into a clean input format suitable for the AI model.

3.  **AI Analysis (GPT):**
    *   Utilizes **GPT-4o Mini** via API key.
    *   Analyzes provided coin data (market info, social buzz).
    *   Ranks coins based on breakout potential.
    *   Outputs results in JSON format (coin name, score 0-10, reason).

4.  **Output Layer:**
    *   Saves analysis results and historical data to a locally stored `cryptos.xlsx` file.
    *   Sends daily alerts for the top 3 coins via a **Telegram Bot**.

5.  **Automation:**
    *   A **GitHub Actions** workflow is configured for daily automated runs.

## Next Steps:

*   Refinement of prompts for potentially better analysis.
*   Adding more data sources if needed.
*   Improving error handling and logging.
